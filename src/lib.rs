//! Linux event device handling.
//!
//! The Linux kernel's "evdev" subsystem exposes input devices to userspace in a generic,
//! consistent way. I'll try to explain the device model as completely as possible. The upstream
//! kernel documentation is split across two files:
//!
//! - <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt>
//! - <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/multi-touch-protocol.txt>
//!
//! The `evdev` kernel system exposes input devices as character devices in `/dev/input`,
//! typically `/dev/input/eventX` where `X` is an integer.
//! Userspace applications can use `ioctl` system calls to interact with these devices.
//! Libraries such as this one abstract away the low level calls to provide a high level
//! interface.
//!
//! Applications can interact with `uinput` by writing to `/dev/uinput` to create virtual
//! devices and send events to the virtual devices.
//! Virtual devices are created in `/sys/devices/virtual/input`.
//!
//! # Devices
//!
//! Devices can be opened directly via their path:
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use evdev::Device;
//! let device = Device::open("/dev/input/event0")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//! This approach requires the calling process to have the appropriate privileges to
//! open the device node (typically this requires running as root user).
//! Alternatively a device can be created from an already open file descriptor. This approach
//! is useful where the file descriptor is provided by an external privileged process
//! (e.g. systemd's logind):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use evdev::Device;
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::os::fd::OwnedFd;
//! let f = File::open("/dev/input/event0")?;
//! let fd = OwnedFd::from(f);
//! let device = Device::from_fd(fd)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Input Events
//!
//! Devices emit events, represented by the [`InputEvent`] struct.
//! A input event has three main fields: event [type](InputEvent::event_type), [code](InputEvent::code)
//! and [value](InputEvent::value)
//!
//! The kernel documentation specifies different event types, reperesented by the [`EventType`] struct.
//! Each device can support a subset of those types. See [`Device::supported_events()`].
//! For each of the known event types there is a new-type wrapper around [`InputEvent`]  
//! in [`event_variants`] see the module documenation for more info about those.
//!
//! For most event types the kernel documentation also specifies a set of codes, represented by a new-type
//! e.g. [`KeyCode`]. The individual codes of a [`EventType`] that a device supports can be retrieved
//! through the `Device::supported_*()` methods, e.g. [`Device::supported_keys()`]:
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use evdev::{Device, KeyCode};
//! let device = Device::open("/dev/input/event0")?;
//! // check if the device has an ENTER key
//! if device.supported_keys().map_or(false, |keys| keys.contains(KeyCode::KEY_ENTER)) {
//!     println!("are you prepared to ENTER the world of evdev?");
//! } else {
//!     println!(":(");
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//! A [`InputEvent`] with a type of [`EventType::KEY`] a code of [`KeyCode::KEY_ENTER`] and a
//! value of 1 is emitted when the Enter key is pressed.
//!
//! All events (even single events) are sent in batches followed by a synchronization event:
//! `EV_SYN / SYN_REPORT / 0`.
//! Events are grouped into batches based on if they are related and occur simultaneously,
//! for example movement of a mouse triggers a movement event for the `X` and `Y` axes
//! separately in a batch of 2 events.
//!
//! The evdev crate exposes functions to query the current state of a device from the kernel, as
//! well as a function that can be called continuously to provide an iterator over update events
//! as they arrive.
//!
//! ## Matching Events
//!
//! When reading from an input Device it is often useful to check which type/code or value
//! the event has. This library provides the [`EventSummary`] enum which can be used to
//! match specific events. Calling [`InputEvent::destructure`] will return that enum.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use evdev::*;
//! let mut device = Device::open("/dev/input/event0")?;
//! loop {
//!     for event in device.fetch_events().unwrap(){
//!         match event.destructure(){
//!             EventSummary::Key(ev, KeyCode::KEY_A, 1) => {
//!                 println!("Key 'a' was pressed, got event: {:?}", ev);
//!             },
//!             EventSummary::Key(_, key_type, 0) => {
//!                 println!("Key {:?} was released", key_type);
//!             },
//!             EventSummary::AbsoluteAxis(_, axis, value) => {
//!                 println!("The Axis {:?} was moved to {}", axis, value);
//!             },
//!             _ => println!("got a different event!")
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # unreachable!()
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Synchronizing versus Raw modes
//!
//! This library can be used in either Raw or Synchronizing modes, which correspond roughly to
//! evdev's `LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL` and `LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC` modes, respectively.
//! In both modes, calling `fetch_events` and driving the resulting iterator to completion
//! will provide a stream of real-time events from the underlying kernel device state.
//! As the state changes, the kernel will write events into a ring buffer. If the buffer becomes full, the
//! kernel will *drop* events from the ring buffer and leave an event telling userspace that it
//! did so. At this point, if the application were using the events it received to update its
//! internal idea of what state the hardware device is in, it will be wrong: it is missing some
//! events.
//!
//! In synchronous mode, this library tries to ease that pain by removing the corrupted events
//! and injecting fake events as if the device had updated normally. Note that this is best-effort;
//! events can never be recovered once lost. This synchronization comes at a performance cost: each
//! set of input events read from the kernel in turn updates an internal state buffer, and events
//! must be internally held back until the end of each frame. If this latency is unacceptable or
//! for any reason you want to see every event directly, a raw stream reader is also provided.
//!
//! As an example of how synchronization behaves, if a switch is toggled twice there will be two switch events
//! in the buffer. However, if the kernel needs to drop events, when the device goes to synchronize
//! state with the kernel only one (or zero, if the switch is in the same state as it was before
//! the sync) switch events will be visible in the stream.
//!
//! This cache can also be queried. For example, the [`DeviceState::led_vals`] method will tell you which
//! LEDs are currently lit on the device. As calling code consumes each iterator, this state will be
//! updated, and it will be fully re-synchronized with the kernel if the stream drops any events.
//!
//! It is recommended that you dedicate a thread to processing input events, or use epoll or an
//! async runtime with the fd returned by `<Device as AsRawFd>::as_raw_fd` to process events when
//! they are ready.
//!
//! For demonstrations of how to use this library in blocking, nonblocking, and async (tokio) modes,
//! please reference the "examples" directory.
