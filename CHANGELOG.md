# Changelog

## evdev next
[8fc58e1...HEAD](https://github.com/emberian/evdev/compare/8fc58e1...HEAD)

### Added
- Create a `...Event` struct for each `EventType` to hold the `InputEvent`
  - Guarantee that each `...Event` struct can only hold a `InputEvent` of the corresponding `EventType`
- Demonstrate what the `FFEvent` does in the `force_feedback` example.

- `Device`, `RawDevice`, and `VirtualDevice` now implement `AsFd`.
- `VirtualDevice::builder()` as an alias for `VirtualDeviceBuilder::new()`
  - `VirtualDeviceBuilder::new()` is now deprecated.

### Changed
- Removed the `evdev::Error` type - fallible functions now just return `io::Error`.
- Consistent naming and structure of all new-types for event-codes
  - Some of them where previously named `...Type` now they are all named `...Code`
  - Rename `InputEventKind` to `EventSummary`
  - Created missing `EventSummary` variants. I know some of them are kind of unused but it is less confusing if they are all there and look the same.
  - Each variant of the `EventSummary` enum now has the structure `Variant(...Event, ...Type, value)`
  - Renamed `Key` struct (the one with all the Key constants) to `KeyCode` to keep the naming consistent!
- Rename `InputEvent::kind` to `InputEvent::destructure` this now returns a `EventSummary`
- `InputEvent::new` no longer takes the `EventType` but `u16` as first argument. If the `EventType` is known we can directly construct the correct variant.
- Ensure the unsafe code still does what we expect.
- Update the Examples.

- The minimum supported rust version (MSRV) is now `1.63`, due to `AsFd` support.
- In order for the `EventStream` types to implement Stream, the `stream-trait`
  feature must now be specified.
- `FFEffect` and `AutoRepeat` are now defined in the root of the crate instead of in `raw_stream`.
- `VirtualDeviceBuilder::with_phys` now accepts a `&CStr` instead of a `&str`.

### Fixed
- Update `VirtualDevice::fetch_events` to yield `InputEvent`s instead of `UInputEvent`s. That was a bug which was not accounted for be the type system. Yielding `UInputEvent`s there will now panic.
